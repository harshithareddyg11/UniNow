# UniNow 🚀  
### Location-Aware College Event Discovery Platform  

> 🏆 Hackathon Project | Team Simplix  

UniNow is a location-aware event discovery and registration platform built to solve a common yet overlooked problem in university towns — **students missing valuable events due to scattered information and unclear eligibility**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

In university ecosystems, college events such as hackathons, workshops, seminars, and cultural fests are announced across multiple channels including WhatsApp groups, posters, and social media. This results in:

- Low event visibility  
- Confusion around eligibility  
- Missed registration deadlines  

Students often discover events too late or are unsure whether they are allowed to participate.

---

## 💡 Our Solution — UniNow

UniNow acts as a **centralized, location-aware discovery platform** that shows students only the events they are **eligible for**, based on:

- 📍 Geographic location  
- 🎓 College eligibility rules  

Registration is built directly into the platform, enabling **instant participation** without external links.

---

## ✨ Innovation & Differentiation

Unlike existing platforms that merely list events:

- 🔍 Filters events by **location + eligibility**
- 🔒 Uses **Smart Eligibility Locks** to avoid confusion
- ⚡ Enables **in-app registration**
- 🎯 Designed specifically for **college ecosystems**

UniNow reduces information overload and ensures **no opportunity goes unnoticed**.
